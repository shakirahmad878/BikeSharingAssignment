# Project Name
Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

## General Information
This project aims to predict the demand for shared bikes based on various factors such as weather, time, season, and other relevant features. Bike sharing systems are increasingly popular in many cities, providing an affordable and sustainable means of transportation for many people. Accurately predicting the demand for bikes can help bike-sharing companies optimize their operations, improve customer satisfaction, and increase profitability.

### Business Problem
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can accurately predict the demand for shared bikes based on various factors. The model should be able to handle both continuous and categorical variables and provide insights into which factors have the most significant impact on bike demand.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Bike Sharing Demand dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains hourly rental data for a bike-sharing system with information on weather, temperature, humidity, season, and other relevant features. The dataset has a total of 17,379 instances and 16 features.

## Conclusions
The demand for shared bikes is highly dependent on factors such as weather, temperature, humidity, and time of day.
The linear regression model built on the training set had an R-squared value of 0.80 and was able to accurately predict the demand for shared bikes on the test set.
The top three features contributing significantly to explaining the demand for shared bikes were temperature, hour, and season.
